# Droplet microfluidics based combinatorial indexing for massive-scale 5′-end single-cell RNA sequencing
  Single-cell RNA sequencing methods focus on the 5’-end of transcripts can reveal promoter and enhancer activity and allows efficient profiling of immune receptor repertoire. However, ultra-high-throughput 5′-end single-cell RNA sequencing methods have not been described. Here, we introduce five-prime end single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA-Seq (FIPRESCI), enabling the massive sample multiplexing and increasing the throughput of the droplet-microfluidics system by over 10-fold. FIPRESCI is based on combining the ability of indexed Tn5 transposome to barcoding RNA/cDNA hybrids heteroduplexes in situ and Template Switching Oligo barcoding of commercial droplet-microfluidic.
